# School Guard Scheduler

This repository contains a Python implementation of a heuristic algorithm designed to solve the problem of organizing school guards' shifts. The algorithm aims to efficiently assign shifts to guards while considering various constraints and ensuring that the coverage is optimal.

## Problem Overview

The task is to organize the shifts of school guards in a way that covers all necessary time slots while respecting constraints such as guard availability and work hours. The goal is to create a feasible and fair schedule that minimizes the need for manual adjustments.

## Algorithm

The core of this project is a heuristic algorithm that uses an iterative approach to assign guards to shifts. The algorithm prioritizes optimization by minimizing conflicts and maximizing coverage, while also considering practical constraints such as guard preferences and work-hour limitations.

## Features

- **Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm**: Assigns guards to shifts based on availability and other constraints.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The algorithm resolves scheduling conflicts and ensures each shift is covered.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to minimize manual intervention by automating the shift assignment process.
- **Flexibility**: Can be adjusted to accommodate different constraints (e.g., maximum work hours, guard preferences).
